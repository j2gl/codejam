# My Notes

Solving needs to do the replace from right to left for any CS to SC

```
CSCSS = 2 + 4 + 4 = 10
SCCSS = 1 + 4 + 4 = 9
SCSCS = 1 + 2 + 4 = 7
SSCCS = 1 + 1 + 4 = 6
SSCSC = 1 + 1 + 2 = 4
SSSCC = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3 
```


```
// Good
CCCSCS = 8 + 16 = 24 
CCCSSC = 8 + 8 = 16

// Bad Example doing from left to right
CCCSCS = 8 + 16 = 24
CCSCCS = 4 + 16 = 20 
CSCCCS = 2 + 16 = 18 
SCCCCS = 1 + 16 = 17
SCCCSC = 1 + 8 = 9 
SCCSCC = 1 + 4 = 5
```
